The Runnable interface is a functional interface introduced in
    Java 1.0 and is located in the java.lang package.
It contains a single run() method, which does not return any
    value and does not throw checked exceptions (except for runtime exceptions).
Runnable tasks are typically used with the Thread class by passing
    an instance of Runnable to the Thread constructor.
Since Java 8, Runnable can be used with lambda expressions and method references.
